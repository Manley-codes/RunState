As of June 25, 2026, the app is a working Java console app named **RunState**.

**Completed phases:**
- Phase 1: Console app — energy system, opening prompt, post-run responses, rolling averages
- Phase 2: MySQL persistence — runs save and load between sessions (`RunStorage.java`, `runstate` DB schema)
- Phase 3: Your Run Style — original pattern detection (`detectRunStyle()` in Runner.java). SUPERSEDED by RunStyle V1, July 10, 2026 (see below).
- Phase 4: AI agent — `RunAgent.java` replaces `buildRunResponse()` with Anthropic API call (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001). Fallback to hardcoded logic on any failure. Gson added for JSON parsing. `Run.java` has `getRunner()` getter added.
- Phase 5 (Steps 1–2): AI context expansion — music context (manual input) + weather (Open-Meteo, `WeatherData` value object, persisted at log time). Built June 26; weather cleanup + TX→Texas fix shipped July 6–7, 2026.
- Effort Cost V1: post-run "How did that run land?" input — `EffortLevel` enum (Smooth/Working/Heavy/Empty tank + internal RPE ranges), persisted at log time, shown in run history and fed to the agent (prompt line + SYSTEM_PROMPT rule + offline fallback). Built July 8–9, 2026 (collector commit 8981b48 + display/agent follow-up).
- Comparison Repair V1: candidate-based run comparison (`ComparisonService` + `ComparisonInsight`) — 180-day/cap-10 selection (route-first, distance-fallback), median aggregation, confidence tiers, four positive signals behind a negative pre-filter — replaces the blended 20-run rolling-average flaw in the AI prompt + fallback. `detectRunStyle()` deferred to the identity redesign. Built July 9, 2026.

**Rename completed June 22, 2026:**
- Package renamed from `com.runclubapp` to `com.runstate` — all 7 source files updated
- `pom.xml` groupId → `com.runstate`, artifactId → `RunState`
- IntelliJ module name still shows "RunNet" — cosmetic only, fix via right-click → Rename in Project panel

**RunStyle V1 — REBUILT July 10, 2026 (replaces the original "Your Run Style"):**
The old faster-AND-farther-vs-rolling-average funnel is GONE. RunStyle V1 is a living,
local, deterministic strategy profile in `RunStyleService` (`Runner.detectRunStyle(Run)`
delegates). Full spec: `design_runstyle_v1.md`. In brief:
- Three primary families — State Lift, Efficiency Gain, Controlled Finish — judged
  point-in-time (a run only counts where its family is measurable).
- Stages from the latest opportunities per family (EARLY 3/4, FORMING 4/5, ESTABLISHED
  6/7); strongest staged family is primary. PR and Demand-Explained color but never lead.
- Secondary context (surface/company/weather/music/shoes) only decorates as association
  facets (descriptive ≥3; comparative 5/5/80%/30pp; one condition + one personal) or a
  frequency-based habit line (≥5 of last 10, ≥70%). Context never creates a pattern.
- Announces only on a first advance or newly qualified facet — never repeats or downgrades.
- Never sent to the AI. Time-of-day identity still OUT (start/end time stored null).

**Next steps (in order):**
1. Phase 5 — DONE (music + weather shipped June 26–July 7, 2026)
2. Effort Cost V1 — DONE (July 8–9, 2026)
3. Comparison Repair V1 — DONE (July 9, 2026); candidate-based comparison replaces the blended-average flaw (AI prompt + fallback; `detectRunStyle()` deferred)
4. Stabilization sprint — DONE (July 10, 2026); privacy/code alignment, RunAgent HTTP timeouts, DB password moved to env var, and the project's first unit tests (see handoff below)
5. **RunStyle V1 — BUILT July 10, 2026 (Steps 0–4 code-complete; see `design_runstyle_v1.md`).** Rebased `detectRunStyle()` off the faster-AND-farther rolling-average rule onto the identity-aligned profile: `RunContext` value object + four new context columns, `RunStyleService`/`RunStyleInsight` with three families / stages / facets / habit / point-in-time announcements, `ComparisonService.evaluateStrict` typed-evidence path (analyze() unchanged), wiring swapped and the rolling-average snapshot deleted. 36 unit tests green. This was comparison path #3, deferred from Comparison Repair V1. **REMAINING (Manley): run the MySQL migration (four ALTER COLUMNs in the design doc) and a live end-to-end log-run against the migrated DB — no Maven/DB was available during the build, so tests ran via a JUnit-platform launcher, not `mvn test`.**
6. Phase 6: lyric-aware music responses (Genius/Musixmatch) — scoped in AI_AGENT.md + design_music_reply_style.md
7. Mobile UI — futuristic/warm transition concept, GPS tracking

**Standing milestone — privacy / security / legal pass (added July 6, 2026):**
Before RunState is released, shared publicly, or gains multi-user/all-day-listening features,
a dedicated pass is REQUIRED covering: data privacy (what leaves the app, to whom, why —
extend docs/DATA_PRIVACY.md), consent tiers (run music vs all-day listening vs any cross-user
data), security (API keys out of source, DB credentials, dedicated DB user not root), and
legal basics (third-party API terms of service — Anthropic, Open-Meteo, Spotify, Last.fm/
ListenBrainz; health-adjacent data handling). Grows in weight with each phase — mobile + GPS
location data raises the bar again. Not a current blocker; IS a release blocker.

Feature map (July 6, 2026) — which features strongly trigger which concern:
- PRIVACY: all-day listening profiling (heaviest — needs its own opt-in tier); GPS routes +
  live location (Phase 6); run/energy data → Anthropic API (live now, covered in
  DATA_PRIVACY.md); city/state → Open-Meteo (live now); cross-user aggregate content
  (Phase 7); run photos (share card/gallery).
- SECURITY: Anthropic API key out of source code; MySQL dedicated user, no root (existing
  rule); Spotify/Last.fm OAuth token storage; server + user accounts if Phase 7 happens.
- LEGAL: lyrics text licensing (Musixmatch paid, Genius scraping = ToS violation) — gates
  the lyric-trigger and lyric-aware reply features; third-party API terms (Spotify's
  data-use rules especially; Open-Meteo attribution); health-adjacent data (HR/effort —
  weight jumps at multi-user); user-generated content moderation if community playlists
  ship (Phase 7).

**Phase 5 plan (locked in, ready to build):**
Both features follow the same four-file pattern:
  Run.java -> add field | RunStorage.java -> add DB column | RunConsole.java -> add optional prompt | RunAgent.java -> add to user message

Step 1 — Music (manual input now, Spotify integration in mobile phase): **BUILT June 26, 2026**
- `musicContext` String field on Run.java (constructor param, last position; getter `getMusicContext()`; no setter — collected at log time like routeName)
- `music_context` column in RunStorage.java INSERT (11th `?`) and read in loadRuns via `rs.getString("music_context")`
- Optional "What were you listening to? (optional):" prompt in RunConsole.logRun(), stored null if skipped
- "Music:" line added to RunAgent.buildUserMessage(); music rule added to SYSTEM_PROMPT (reference artist/song only when it genuinely fits — never force)
- AI_AGENT.md data contract updated with the Music line
- DB MIGRATION REQUIRED on the user's MySQL: `ALTER TABLE runs ADD COLUMN music_context VARCHAR(255) NULL;` (run manually — saveRun will fail until this exists)

**Future refinement — music reference variety (user note, June 26, 2026):**
When automation arrives (Spotify) and a runner plays the same song often, the agent must NOT keep
referencing that same song every run. Need variety logic — e.g. vary which track/artist gets called out,
or weight toward less-recently-mentioned songs — so references stay fresh. Belongs in Phase 5 advanced /
Phase 6 lyric-aware work, where the agent gains cross-run awareness. Not needed for manual Step 1.

Step 2 — Weather (automatic via Open-Meteo): **✅ SHIPPED. Cleanup completed July 6–7, 2026.**
Built June 26, 2026, then reconciled to full spec in the Step 2.5 cleanup (commits 8fa05c9 + 9ad3376),
with the TX→Texas geocoding fix following July 7. `design_weather_cleanup.md` is now the historical
build record; original spec is `design_weather_context.md`. What shipped:
- Fetch happens ONCE at log time and is STORED on the Run (persistence bug fixed — weather was lost before).
- Isolated `WeatherService` class owns geocoding + the Open-Meteo call (SRP, like RunAgent).
- `WeatherData` value object holds three fields: `temperature`, `apparentTemperature` ("feels-like"),
  `weatherCondition` — nullable `Double`, so 0.0 is a real temperature and null means "not recorded."
- Forecast API (today + ~92 days) instead of the archive API, so fresh runs get data.
- HttpClient connect + request timeout (5s) so a slow API never hangs the console.
- Failure never blocks logging — WeatherData stays all-null, the agent shows "Not available."
- State-based geocoding disambiguation now works: WeatherService canonicalizes abbreviations
  (`STATE_NAMES` map + `normalizeState`) so "TX" matches Open-Meteo's "Texas".
- Privacy doc written: `docs/DATA_PRIVACY.md`. AI_AGENT.md data contract updated.

**Constructor design decision — RESOLVED & BUILT (July 6, 2026):**
Chose Option B — a `WeatherData` value object groups temperature/apparentTemperature/weatherCondition
into one constructor param (composition) instead of appending 3 raw params. Shipped as `WeatherData.java`.

**Visual prototype:**
RunState_intro.html and RunState Promo.html exist in project root — both gitignored (local only).
Do NOT use as final look yet — intentionally unfinished.
Colors, branding, and button hierarchy are strong. Runner animation unfinished.

## Handoff — stabilization sprint complete (July 10, 2026)

**Where we are:** A four-task stabilization sprint shipped, each as its own commit, before
starting the Run Style redesign. All four are done and verified:

1. **Privacy doc ↔ code alignment.** `RunAgent.buildUserMessage()` no longer sends the runner's
   real username (a constant `"Runner"` label stands in); `DATA_PRIVACY.md` updated to match and
   its stale "rolling average pace/distance" bullet replaced with the candidate-based comparison
   summary that actually gets sent.
2. **RunAgent HTTP timeouts.** Added a reusable static `CLIENT` with a 5s connect timeout plus a
   5s per-request timeout (mirrors WeatherService). Verified a timeout throws an `Exception`
   subclass that the existing `catch` already handles → falls back instead of hanging.
3. **DB password out of source.** `RunStorage` reads `RUNSTATE_DB_PASSWORD` from the environment
   (same pattern as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`); throws a clear `SQLException` if unset. Still uses the
   dedicated `runstate_user`, never root. **Run-environment note:** the IntelliJ run config (and
   any shell that runs the app) must define `RUNSTATE_DB_PASSWORD` or the DB connection fails.
4. **First unit tests.** JUnit 5 (Jupiter) added, `test` scope. Tests live in a top-level `test/`
   dir (kept out of `src/` because the pom points `sourceDirectory` at `src`; set via
   `<testSourceDirectory>test</testSourceDirectory>`). `ComparisonServiceTest` has 9 tests
   covering candidate selection (recency window, cap-10, route-first, distance fallback), median
   aggregation (odd/even, outlier resistance vs mean), and the negative pre-filter (lower lift and
   unexplained higher effort filtered; explained PR effort allowed). Run with `mvn test` or the
   IntelliJ ▶ gutter arrows. Tested through the public `analyze(...)` only — internals stay private.

**First thing to do next session: the Run Style redesign** (step 5 in the roadmap above) —
rebase `detectRunStyle()` off the faster-AND-farther rolling-average rule. Handoff detail lives in
`design_comparison_logic_fix.md` (path #3) and the Run Style design notes.

**Security-milestone reminder (unchanged):** rotating the DB password to a strong, unique value
belongs in the pre-release security pass — not the local-dev "basic" password used now.

## Handoff — next session entry point (July 7, 2026)

**Where we are:** Phase 5 is functionally complete. Step 1 (music) and Step 2 (weather) are both
built, committed, and pushed. The weather cleanup (Step 2.5) and the TX→Texas geocoding fix shipped
July 6–7, 2026 and are verified end-to-end. Privacy doc is done. No open weather work remains.
Manley is taking a break here to review the whole app before building deeper.

**First thing to do in the next session:**
Nothing weather-related is pending. Backend queue (order clarified July 7, 2026 after a
mislabel — reply-style is prompt-only and is NOT the lyric-API feature):
1. Music reply-style craft rules (`design_music_reply_style.md`) — the decided next task
   from the July 6 backend session. Prompt-only (SYSTEM_PROMPT + buildUserMessage), no
   schema changes, no new APIs. Smallest step, immediately improves the signature moment.
2. Effort input + comparison fix (`design_effort_cost.md` + `design_comparison_logic_fix.md`) —
   core-strengthening, all-local; effort data is what the comparison fix needs.
3. LATER, Phase 6: lyric-aware replies via a lyrics API — gated by the lyrics-licensing
   legal flag (Musixmatch paid; Genius scraping violates ToS). Lyric references follow the
   spectrum in design_music_reply_style.md rule 5 (creative theme-fit default; selective
   exact/near-exact quotes allowed; distinctive-line quoting = deferred legal-pass item,
   NOT banned — Manley decides).
Order of 1 vs 2 is Manley's call; both are ready.

**July 6, 2026 — UI phase paused; back to backend.**
UI/creative-direction exploration is paused (see creative_direction_ui.md v0.2 — §0 has the
locked July decisions reconciled from the prompt-iteration sessions). Moodboard is gitignored
(local only, like the HTML prototypes); creative_direction_ui.md is the surviving text record.
Current focus: the weather cleanup above.
NOTE FOR LATER (not a current focus): the UI "State Scan" concept implies FOUR pre-run energy
states, but the backend energy system is THREE levels. Open question — resolve when UI work
resumes, before Phase 6. Do not change the backend enum for it now.

**Current weather architecture (post-cleanup, for reference):**
- `WeatherData.java` — immutable value object (nullable `Double` temperature/apparentTemperature,
  String weatherCondition; final fields, no setters).
- `WeatherService.java` — `static WeatherData fetch(city, state, date)`; owns geocoding (forecast API),
  WMO code decoding, timeouts, and TX→Texas state canonicalization (`STATE_NAMES` + `normalizeState`).
- `Run.java` — one `WeatherData` constructor param (last position); null-safe delegating getters.
- `RunConsole.logRun()` — fetches weather BEFORE saveRun so it persists.
- `RunStorage.java` — INSERT has 14 columns incl. `apparent_temperature` (setObject for nullable
  Doubles); loadRuns reads the three weather columns via `rs.getObject` into a `WeatherData`.
- `RunAgent.java` — no longer fetches weather; `describeWeather(run)` formats the stored values.
`design_weather_context.md` still holds the original spec (WMO mapping, API URLs) for reference.
Note: `Runner.getCity()/getState()` exist (added June 26).

**Collab rules to follow:**
- One decision or one file at a time — never dump a full plan in one response
- Explain Java/OOP concepts as you build (value object, nullable Double, setObject vs setDouble, etc.)
- Present options with a recommendation; user decides before code is written
- Flag when it's a good time to commit
